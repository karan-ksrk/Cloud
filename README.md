<h2 id="main-characteristics-of-cloud-computing"><strong>Main Characteristics of Cloud Computing</strong></h2>
<p>The five major characteristics of the Cloud Computing are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-demand self-service</strong>  - The service of the cloud is available round the clock and provides computing capabilities on-demand of the user automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Broad network access</strong>  - Users can access the services via different modes as the heterogeneous thin and thick client platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Resource pooling</strong>  - The feature of multi-tenancy where users are assigned resources dynamically, based on demands.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid elasticity</strong>– The service is flexible and can be scaled up or down to suit the business requirements. Resources and programs can be used based on requirement and the user is billed only for the usage.</li>
<li><strong>Measured service</strong>  – Usage metering is available and you pay only for what you use. You need not pay for any infrastructure that you do not use.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="measuring-the-cloud’s-value">Measuring the Cloud’s Value</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cloud computing presents new opportunities to users and developers because it is based on the paradigm of a shared multitenant utility. The ability to access pooled resources on a pay-as-you-go basis provides a number of system characteristics that completely alter the economics of information technology infrastructures and allows new types of access and business models for user applications.</li>
<li>Any application or process that benefits from economies of scale, commoditization of assets, and conformance to programming standards benefits from the application of cloud computing.</li>
<li>Any application or process that requires a completely customized solution, imposes a high degree of specialization, and requires access to proprietary technology is going to expose the limits of cloud computing rather quickly.</li>
<li>Applications that work with cloud computing are ones that I refer to as “low touch” applications; they tend to be applications that have low margins and usually low risk. The “high touch” applications that come with high margins require committed resources and pose more of a risk; those applications are best done on-premises.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="avoiding-capital-expenditure">Avoiding Capital Expenditure</h2>
<p>Cloud Computing enables CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) savings as businesses no longer need to invest in costly infrastructure.<br>
The very nature of the cloud, reduces OPEX (Operational Expenditure) that would be very difficult, if not impossible to replicate in an on premises environment. Things like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay for what you use with automation and scripts designed to flex the infrastructure to meet the peaks and valleys of your business needs.</li>
<li>Standardized SKUs that allow you to quickly and easily turn up new resources without having to spec and test them for performance and compatibility.</li>
<li>Disaster recovery that is built in and automatically expands and contracts as your usage changes.</li>
<li>Built in intelligence that monitors the health of the system.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="computing-the-total-cost-of-ownership">Computing the Total cost of ownership</h2>
<ul>
<li>TCO is the metric that organizations use to quantify and measure cloud adoption success.</li>
<li>This perspective helps you understand the return on investment so that we can prioritize and focus.</li>
<li>By capturing the key cost considerations, we gain a workable model that we can use to make informed decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="understanding-services-and-applications-by-type"><strong>Understanding Services and applications by Type</strong></h1>
<p>There are different service models in Cloud computing. With the advancement of technology, newer service models are evolving. However there are 3 major service models for Cloud Computing. These are <strong>Iaas</strong>, <strong>Paas</strong>, and <strong>SaaS</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Iaas</strong>  – In Infrastructe as a Service, users can access the infrastructure required to run their applications, storage, operating systems, etc. The infrastructure can be servers, storage, and virtualization infrastructure and so on. Buying and installing these infrastructure can be very expensive process for the organizations. And more expense would be there on the maintenance part. So the IaaS model is a reliable and cost effective method for the users to run their businesses. For example, if in an organization, virtualization infrastructure is required for a new project with less funding, acquiring the expensive infrastructure will not be possible. Here IaaS is the best option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paas</strong>  – In Platform as a Service, users are provided the platform to develop and run their applications. Changing the platform, upgrading to a newer version, or maintaining uniformity in the platform used by all employees of a company is possible at a less expenditure with PaaS. For example, if you are working on an experimental project where you wouldn’t want to spend more on the development, you can opt for PaaS. This way, you save money and effort by not having the need to buy the platforms and hire people to maintain them. There are platform operators who will help you when in need of help. The user need not manage any of the underlying cloud infrastructure, but can manage the applications required for the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SaaS</strong>  – In Software as a Service, user can access software applications from the cloud. You no longer would need to buy the expensive software. You can access the software through a thin client interface, like a web browser. Similar to the other service models, you cannot control the underlying infrastructure. You can run the applications in the cloud and the cloud administrator manages the portions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="understanding-abstraction-and-virtualization"><strong>Understanding Abstraction and Virtualization</strong></h1>
<h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of an operating system, computer, application, or any    	computing resource. Partitioning a hard drive is also a virtualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term is virtualization as the users or applications can communicate with the virtual resources just like these would with logical resources. Using this process, multiple operating systems can run on a system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logical view of resources makes it easier to enhance the performance of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key benefit of virtualization is that it makes your infrastructure more efficient. The performance, availability of resources, and automation becomes better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you use cloud computing, you are accessing pooled resources using a technique called virtualization. Virtualization assigns a logical name for a physical resource and then provides a pointer to that physical resource when a request is made. Virtualization provides a means to manage resources efficiently because the mapping of virtual resources to physical resources can be both dynamic and facile. Virtualization is dynamic in that the mapping can be assigned based on rapidly changing conditions, and it is facile because changes to a mapping assignment can be nearly instantaneous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Virtualization</strong><br>
This involves the process of combining physical storage devices into one virtualized storage environment. This technology helps in the separation of physical storage systems from virtual storage partitions. It is extremely helpful for administrators to have extended control over the resources and in turn, for the storage allocation across users and projects. Migrating data from one storage device to another can also be done seamlessly, without the end users being impacted. This technology is often used parallel with server virtualization to reduce costs and for easier implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware Virtualization</strong><br>
The conversion of a physical system to a virtual system is termed as Hardware Virtualization. The Virtual Machine performs just like a physical machine. The software and applications remain on the physical system. The virtual image of the software and applications is what is installed on the virtual server and accessed by the virtual machine. This is the most commonly used type of virtualization owing to the ease of upgrades, cost factor, and enhanced usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating system Virtualization</strong><br>
In this type of virtualization, the operating system of a desktop system is moved to a virtual environment. So, the while the system is your physical one, the operating system is hosted on a virtual server, located somewhere else. The advantage of moving the operating system to the virtual server is that the copies of the same operating system can be used by multiple users. You would require a Virtual Machine Manager for this model to work. This technology definitely saves cost on the extra systems and operating systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Five key attributes of cloud computing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service-based:</strong> A service-based architecture is where clients are abstracted from service providers through service interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable and elastic:</strong> Services can be altered to affect capacity and performance on demand.</li>
<li><strong>Shared services:</strong> Resources are pooled in order to create greater efficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>Metered usage:</strong> Services are billed on a usage basis.</li>
<li><strong>Internet delivery:</strong> The services provided by cloud computing are based on Internet protocols and formats.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="content-distribution-network-cdn"><strong>Content Distribution Network (CDN)</strong></h2>
<p>CDN is a big distributed server system, which are deployed in different data centers, connected through the Internet. The objective of CDN is serving content with high availability and performance to customers. Some examples would the downloadable objects like the media files and software, web objects like text and scripts, live streaming content, social network, and e-commerce applications.</p>
<p>In this technology, content is replicated and available on different servers, located globally. There can be thousands of servers, which makes the availability of the same content to global users at the same time possible. To optimize the speed of delivery of the content, when the request is placed, the content is provided from the server closest to the user. Hence, there would be no delay even if multiple users try to access the same content at the same time. CDN also offers advanced data backup and archiving. So CDN is widely used by businesses depending on online data backup.</p>
<p>The concept and implementation of CDN is important for virtualization and cloud computing so that the servers can be strategically be placed closest to the users for better performance.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="load-balancing-and-virtualization"><strong>Load Balancing and Virtualization</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>The technology used to distribute service requests to resources is referred to as load balancing.</li>
<li>Load balancing can be implemented in hardware, as is the case with F5’s BigIP servers, or in software, such as the Apache mod_proxy_balancer extension,</li>
<li>Load balancing is an optimization technique; it can be used to increase utilization and throughput, lower latency, reduce response time, and avoid system overload.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following network resources can be load balanced:</strong><br>
- Network interfaces and services such as DNS, FTP, and HTTP.<br>
- Connections through intelligent switches. 	<br>
- Processing through computer system assignment.<br>
- Storage resources l Access to application instances.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-hypervisors"><strong>Understanding Hypervisors</strong></h2>
<p>Load balancing virtualizes systems and resources by mapping a logical address to a physical address.<br>
The downside of virtual machine technologies is that having resources indirectly addressed means there is some level of overhead.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A low-level program is required to provide system resource access to virtual machines, and this program is referred to as the hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).</strong>
<ul>
<li>A hypervisor running on bare metal is a Type 1 VM or native VM.</li>
<li>Examples of Type 1 Virtual Machine Monitors are LynxSecure, RTS Hypervisor, Oracle VM, Sun xVM Server, 		 VirtualLogix VLX, VMware ESX and ESXi, and Wind River VxWorks, among others.</li>
<li>Type 1 VMs have no host operating system because they are installed on a bare system.</li>
<li>An operating system running on a Type 1 VM is a <strong>full virtualization</strong> because it is a complete simulation of the hardware that it is running on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
